Bottles, my chain child that is to understand simple language
Written by Chris Rhodes as a pet project
If this goes anywhere it will be a miricle

First steps:
Getting Bottles to able to break down sentances into description (Adjective), Objects (Noun) and actions (Verbs)
E.G
Bottles should be able to tell that the sentance "I'm bored" contains the object (I'm) and the break down of bored to object with a description.
Once this has happened Bottles should then be able to ask/tell that the user has a negative state of bored and find a way to remove the negative from bored.

Second Step:
Bottles should now be able to de-code given sentances using given definations
Bottles should now use an online dictionary/stored dictionary to look up words, definations, synonyms and antonyms. Using the lookup be able to create assoicates for actions and suggestions based on past experiences

Third Step:
Haven't thought that far ahead. Hopefull speech recogniation and speech creation(Bottles speakes to me). Also hopefully put Bottles on raspberry pie or something.

End
